## ABOUT
This is a server/client system that uses UNIX signals for communication. The server displays its PID and receives decrypted signals as characters, while the client encrypts messages and sends true/false signals using SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2 to the server's PID.

> [!NOTE]
> For the rest of the projects and exams in the cursus, <a href="https://github.com/jotavare/42-common-core">click here</a>.

## HOW TO USE
#### 1º - Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jotavare/minitalk
```

#### 2º - Enter the project folder and run `make`
```bash
cd minitalk/minitalk
make
```

#### 3º - Run the server and copy its PID
```bash
./server
```

#### 4º - Open another terminal, paste the PID and write a message
```bash
./client [SERVER PID] [MESSAGE]
```

> [!NOTE]
> `make bonus` writes the bonus build over the same `server` and `client`
> names, so the commands above do not change. Run `make` to go back to the
> mandatory version.

#### MAKEFILE RULES

`make` - Compile minitalk **mandatory** files.

`make bonus` - Compile minitalk **bonus** files.

`make all` - Same as `make`, compile minitalk **mandatory** files.

`make clean` - Delete all .o (object files) files.

`make fclean` - Delete all .o (object files) and .a (executable) files.

`make re` - Use rules `fclean` + `all`.

## MANDATORY
- [x] Produce server and client executables.
- [x] The Client must communicate a string passed as a parameter to the server (referenced by its process ID) and display it.
- [x] Use `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` signals only.

## BONUS
- [x] Add reception acknowledgement system.
- [x] Support Unicode characters.

## NORMINETTE
> At 42 School, it is expected that almost every project is written following the Norm, which is the coding standard of the school.

```
- No for, do...while, switch, case, goto, ternary operators, or variable-length arrays allowed;
- Each function must be a maximum of 25 lines, not counting the function's curly brackets;
- Each line must be at most 80 columns wide, with comments included;
- A function can take 4 named parameters maximum;
- No assigns and declarations in the same line (unless static);
- You can't declare more than 5 variables per function;
- ...
```

## DEBUGGING
> Transmission is timing sensitive: the client sends one bit per signal and
> waits for the server to acknowledge, so a dropped or reordered signal shows
> up as a garbled character rather than an error.

Compile with `-g` to keep the symbols the debuggers need:

```bash
make fclean && make CFLAGS="-Wall -Wextra -Werror -g"
```

`valgrind --leak-check=full ./server` - Report memory that was allocated and never freed; the server accumulates the message as it arrives.

`gdb -p $(pgrep server)` - Attach to a running server and break inside the handler to watch the bits assemble.

`strace -e trace=kill,rt_sigaction ./client PID "hi"` - Show every signal actually sent, which is the quickest way to see a transmission stall.

Worth testing with a long message, with UTF-8 (a multi-byte character is several
signals, not one), and with a PID that does not exist.
